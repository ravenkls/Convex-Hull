# Convex Hull

In mathematics, the convex hull or convex envelope or convex closure of a set X of points in the Euclidean plane or in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an affine space over the reals) is the smallest convex set that contains X. For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around X.

## What I Learnt
 - Using numpy for linear algebra
 - Using matplotlib to visualise what I am doing
 - Thinking graphically to solve the problem
